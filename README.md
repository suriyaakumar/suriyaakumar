## About Me

I work as a Software Developer in Cloudify and I mainly work with Javascript and REST APIs. I write integration workflows between platforms and develop connectors for APIs as well as being involved in front-end app development. In my spare time, I choose to improve my skills by working on new and existing personal projects and experiment with them.

I can be contacted via Linkedin or email and you can do so, by clicking the respective platform badges above.
